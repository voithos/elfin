# Elfin

Elfin is a timing-based puzzle platformer that follows the journey of a little sprite as it tries to escape the underground labyrinth.

In Elfin, you cannot directly jump (or move, really). Instead, you must use anchors in the environment to move around, exerting force towards them or away from them.

## Controls

Left-click to pull, right-click to push. F11 for fullscreen, and Esc to exit.

## GMTK Game Jam

Elfin was made in Godot for the GMTK Jam 2018, which had the theme "GENRE without MECHANIC" - in this case, PLATFORMER without JUMPING (or normal movement in general).
